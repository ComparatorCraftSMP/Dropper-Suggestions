### Suggester is a bot that manages server suggestions, allowing staff to review suggestions before they are posted and manage them in many ways.

Suggester is a **public** bot available for everyone. You can find more information about the bot in its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/G5pEdUp" target="_blank">Support Server</a>.

We didn't code the entire bot, this was forked from <a href="https://github.com/Suggester/Suggester/" target="_blank">Suggestor</a>
